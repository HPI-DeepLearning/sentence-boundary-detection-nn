Evaluation of results:
\begin{itemize}
\item F-measure for each class is calculated.
\item Harmonic mean for all F-measures is total score (higher is better).
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Harmonic mean between all f1 scores for all classes. \emph{2/5} means window size of five and punctuation is tested at position two. If \emph{wi} is in the label, it uses wikipedia training data.}

Comparison between experiments with and without POS tagging (other than that, they have the same configurations):
\begin{itemize}
\item With POS tagging: 0.305
\item Without POS tagging: 0.275
\end{itemize}

Comparison between experiments with and without wikipedia data (other than that, they have the same configurations):
\begin{itemize}
\item Without wikipedia: 0.385
\item With wikipedia data: 0.252
\end{itemize}
